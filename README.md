# Tawny-Portfolio: React Portfolio

## Description
As a junior developer I wanted to try my hand at building a single-page application using React. In this case, I built a portfolio to highlight my programing experience and previous work. 

## Installation
- `git clone git@github.com:gemsjohn/tawny-port.git`
- Open the cloned folder in Visual Studio
- Run `npm start` in the Integrated Terminal. This will Run the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## What is unique about this React-App?

This application leverages readily available resources such as [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [Formik](https://formik.org/), and [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/). Combined, these resources produce a single page application that allows the viewer to navigate to six different examples of my work, contact me using the Formik form, and download a PDF version of my resume.
